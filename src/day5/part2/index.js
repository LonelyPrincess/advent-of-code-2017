/**
 * --- Day 5: A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike - Part II ---
 *
 * This function solves a jump instructions maze. In each step,
 * the system jumps the number of positions contained in the current
 * position (offset).
 *
 * Before jumping, that offset is incremented by 1 if it was lower than
 * 3 and decrease it by 1 otherwise.
 *
 * The process doesn't end until the system jumps out to a non-existant
 * index of the jump instructions array.

 *
 * @param {string} maze - An array of numbers representing the jump instructions.
 * @return {number}  Number of steps required to find an exit to the maze.
