/**
 * --- Day 5: A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike - Part I ---
 *
 * This function solves a jump instructions maze. In each step,
 * the system jumps the number of positions contained in the current
 * position. Before jumping, that position of the maze is incremented
 * in one unit.
 *
 * The process doesn't end until the system jumps out to a non-existant
 * index of the jump instructions array.

 * @return {number}  Number of steps required to find an exit to the maze.
