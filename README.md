This repository contains a collection of modules developed in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) that solve the different challenges proposed in [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017). The [Jasmine framework](https://jasmine.github.io/) has also been used to develop unit tests within the project.

## Project structure

The project is divided in multiple folders, one for each of the available challenges. Inside of these folders you'll find:

* The code for the function that solves the problem.
* Unit tests to verify the function returns the expected results.
* A `README.md` file including a description of the puzzle and the obtained results.

## Challenge status

The following list describes which of the puzzles have been solved so far in this project, and which are still on the works. This will be updated as progress is made and more modules become available.
