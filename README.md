This repository contains a collection of scripts developed in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) that solve the different challenges proposed in [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017).

The project is divided in multiple folders, one for each of the available challenges. Inside of these folders you'll find:

* The code for the function that solves the problem.
* Unit tests to verify the function returns the expected results. These tests make use of the [Jasmine framework](https://jasmine.github.io/).
